# TCP Gecko dotNet
A Wii U debugger using a network connection. This is a port of the excellent Wii debugger Gecko dotNet to the Wii U, using a TCP connection to a small resident handler as a medium. This project is just the debugger, the handler is elsewhere.

This program should be considered experimental, many features will not work as they have simply not been implemented. Over time I hope it will grow into a fully fledged debugging tool. Bug reports and fixes are welcome!
